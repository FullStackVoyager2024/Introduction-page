    Introduction 
</h2>

<p>
    Hello! My name is Krishna. I am currently a student pursuing my graduation, and I have a strong interest in technology and personal development. I believe in learning consistently and putting in effort to become a better version of myself each day.

In my free time, I enjoy writing motivational blogs, reading self-help books, exploring web development, listening to podcasts, and learning about financial literacy. I also like traveling and spending time reflecting on how to grow mentally and emotionally.

I consider myself a curious learner who enjoys staying productive, discovering new skills, and connecting with positive, like-minded people. My goal is to stay calm, focused, and make each day meaningful.
